    title: "Youth Led Hubs"
    text: "#ASKnet is a capacity building and hub development program linking South Sudanese youth-led community hubs, be they in South Sudan or neighboring regions. 
    <br><br>
    The program started in 2015 with the creation of a community-based media training center, Juba’s Open Knowledge and Innovation Hub (<a href=\"https://openculture.agency/innovation-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">jHUB</a>) which aimed to provide an open forum to discuss, identify, and develop solutions for South Sudan’s post-conflict challenges. Conflict flared up again at the end of 2016 and the jHUB community was dispersed. The program has since evolved into a collection of smaller hubs and local initiatives in South Sudan and Uganda known as #ASKnet. 
    <br><br>
    This community continues to grow, move and intersect with other like-minded individuals and organizations at the grassroots and beyond creating opportunities for collaborations, training, and knowledge sharing. Meet the #ASKnet Hubs!"

    The directory makes it easier for organizations be they international donors and non-governmental agencies, local, national, and international governmental organizations, local companies, etc., - to contact and commission #ASKnet media and technology experts in the region. 
    <br><br>
    The LEAD directory allows professionals, and individuals with special skills in South Sudan and refugee-hosting regions to develop profiles, share their expertise, and promote themselves both locally and internationally. We require experts to add references/links to their work to allow partners and/or future clients to access the experts' previous work and portfolios in order to create confidence and credibility.
